Some example cron scripts

scheduled_rsync
- an example to have something rsynced on a regular basis to another server/destination.
- Has a basic locking mechanism to stop parallel processes from running.
- basic logging to /var/log
  - Recommend also setting up a log rotate script.
  
scheduled_rsync_parallel
- Same as scheduled_rsync except it is capable of launching parallel rsync processes for each of the sub directories.
- Can launch a limited number of sub processes and loop until all of the directories have been backed up.
